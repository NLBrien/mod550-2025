    "Main script is **MOD550-P1-NLB-Task_2**, which contains callbacks for different machine learning operators in Python. These operators are defined in **MOD550_P1_NLB_DEF_functions.ipynb**, initially coded individually in Python scripts (PYTHON_DEF_...).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Before running different operators on the selected dataset (Global Report on Food Crises, GRFC 2025, with data from 2016 to 2024), multiple data manipulation and cleaning steps were required.  \n",
    "The project goal is to predict if a country, will go into a state of food crisis depending on several features such as:\n",
    "- Region (continent)  \n",
    "- Previous food crisis phase (level 1 {least} to 5 {worst})  \n",
    "- Total country population  \n",
    "- Total country GDP  \n",
    "- GDP per capita  \n",
    "\n",
    "Other characteristics like population birth rate or total food production (in tons) would have been interesting to include, but the data available from open‑source databases was limited.\n",

    "## Challenges\n",
    "Most of the time was spent on data manipulation, merging, and cleaning. Most errors came from data mismatches or functions not running due to inconsistent formats. Data manipulation is much easier when visualized with tools like Excel. Python’s text‑only terminal can be harder for beginners to interpret and visualize clearly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As this was my first time coding in Python, the learning curve was especially steep. There are many different ways and modules to run similar functions, and online references for learning can be inconsistent. The lack of script examples in class lectures and exercises made knowledge retention more difficult. Even after taking online classes on Python basics and spending many hours watching tutorials and practicing, the required level for a fluid workflow has not been reached yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Data Analysis\n",
    "The initial dataset was not usable in its original form. Many manipulations were required before running any scripts. Operators were very sensitive to sparse and inconsistent data. A lot of time was spent understanding the data and arranging formats to merge external complementary datasets such as *total country population*, *total country GDP*, and *GDP per capita*. I tested multiple approaches to ensure the data structure was compatible before merging. Once the merge was successful, an export file was generated in CSV format for further use.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before coding direct operations on the data, I completed individual Python operator scripts for later callbacks in the main program. All operators were coded in a general optic in mind to improve reusability in a near future. Some concepts and explanations were covered in MOD550 course lectures, but most references and application examples came from online sources. All references used are listed in the main data script (second notebook cell).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Not being able to launch the previously separated operator classes from their original scripts due to kernel and interpreter issues that I could not solve, I transferred all the code into a *Jupyter Notebook* format. I knew I could run the necessary functions this way. Therefore, I copied all the function classes into one notebook file and found a method to import functions from one notebook into another (main script). After testing, this solution worked successfully and I was able to start coding the main script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, even after spending a lot of time managing and transforming the datasets, this was not enough, and I still encountered multiple issues when executing the operators. After extensive trial and error and troubleshooting, I was able to create a more usable dataset. Once the data was fitted to the operators, some minor changes were needed to improve computation and result visualization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, results would be more meaningful with a non‑binary target variable. Looking back, it would have been more interesting to use a 2D target instead of a binary one. Unfortunately, due to lack of time, I had to continue with the solution I had already implemented to fix errors and simplify data management.\n",
