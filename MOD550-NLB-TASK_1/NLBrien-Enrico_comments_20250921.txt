Git repo: it work, but it is unclear where to find what. Also there are many files that I do not know how to use (for this you could guide me via a readme).

Readme.md: Simple, it contains the essential but it lacks guidance in how to use the repo you built

Task 1.1: missing 

Task 1.2: missing

Task 1.3: missing

Task 1.4: missing

Task 1.5: missing


Comment:
It is good that you started working with your project dataset, but you need to complete tasks 1.1 to 1.5 to pass the assignemnt.
I maybe miss some in the code, there are multiple files and not a clear instruction how to deal with that.
Please make a jupyter notebook for all the task 1, as described in canvas. Put in that folder a jupyter notebook and a .py file where you functions/classes are defined. Ask for clarifications if needed.

The code also doesn't run:     raise KeyError(key) from err
KeyError: '2016'

SyntaxError: (unicode error) 'unicodeescape' codec can't decode bytes in position 66-67: truncated \UXXXXXXXX escape

SyntaxError: invalid syntax

etc

As the assigmenents are mandatory, You have one week (27.9.2025) to complete task 1.1 to 1.5 to qualify to take the exam.
